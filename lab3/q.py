# Q. Block cipher ‘Mode of Operation’: ECB and CBC
# As discussed, the ECB mode of operation leaves too many clues in the ciphertext
# for an attacker due to repetitive pattern in the input. Take an image data and
# demonstrate the same considering DES or AES as your underlying block cipher.
# Next encrypt the same image using CBC mode of operation and justify why such
# repetitions are not visible. You can use any programming language of your
# choice
